🛒 Retail Project – Sales & Customer Insights
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes retail sales data (2016–2017) to uncover trends, customer demographics, and product performance insights. 
The goal is to provide data-driven strategies that improve sales, optimize inventory, and enhance customer engagement.

The analysis is performed using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) in Jupyter Notebook, and the results are summarized in a presentation (PPT) with visualizations and strategic recommendations.

📊 Key Analyses
1. Time-Based Sales Analysis
Monthly sales trend shows consistent year-over-year growth.
December is the peak sales month (holiday/festive season).
Weekends account for almost double the sales of weekdays.

✅ Strategies: Pre-festival campaigns, weekend flash offers, optimized staffing & stock alignment.

2. Demographic Analysis
Core customer group: Families aged 35–54 with income between $50K–$99K.
Singles and lower-income segments remain under-penetrated.

✅ Strategies: Introduce family bundles & loyalty tiers, Launch budget packs for low-income groups.

3. Product Performance Analysis
Groceries & Beverages are the highest revenue drivers.
Average basket size increased from $28 (2016) → $42 (2017).
Pareto Rule (80/20): 20% of SKUs contribute ~80% of sales.

✅ Strategies:Ensure stock availability of top SKUs, Use cross-selling & bundling to boost basket size.
